In addition to a velocity component, this function also depends on the temperature (*T*) and the molar mass of the molecule (*M*); we say it is <em>parameterized</em> by these quantitites.

That's interesting, isn't it? it means you ought to be able to predict the effects of a higher or lower mass based on what you've observed about a higher or lower temperature. **So try this**: make a _prediction_ about how $f_B(v_x)$ would change (qualitatively) for, say, $H_2$ (would the distribution be broader or narrower? Taller or shorter?). Then use python to re-calculate $f_B(v_x)$ for $H_2$ by modifying the molar mass you entered at the start of this exercise (see the third executable cell) to see how your prediction fared.\n",
