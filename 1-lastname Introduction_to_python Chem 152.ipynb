It was first released in 1991. Python is a great language for beginner programmers because it was designed with the newcomer in mind. Python was designed to be readable and it has a simple and consistent syntax. Additionally, Python has a very extensive section of mathematical and scientific libraries. These libraries contain code that has already been written to perform specific tasks so you just need to know how to call the library rather than write the code itself. Lastly, Python is free.\n","\n","\n","Here, the basic plan is for you to get used to some of the basics of python usage: how to use it as a fancy calculator, how to make simple plots, and how to debug when you get an error.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"j-ucm_6Z3xn-"},"source":["## In-class activities  \n","First, you need to import (or bring in) the libraries for numerical operations and graphics.
